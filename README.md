# Tic Tac Toe AI with MiniMax Algorithm

This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent using the MiniMax algorithm. The MiniMax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that is commonly used in game theory and artificial intelligence.

## Features

- Play against an AI opponent that uses the MiniMax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- Interactive command-line interface for playing the game.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```shell
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Run the game:

    ```shell
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell.
- The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- The AI opponent will make its move using the MiniMax algorithm, aiming to win or force a draw.
